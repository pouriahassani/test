A tremendous time has been spent on this work. But it is extremeely buggy and very hard to work with, I want to build this project as a world class project, highly modular and highly user firenfly and flexiible. there are many things that should be fixed. first it needs propaer env. right now it works with docker container where ubuntu 18.04 is used and the gmu toolchain  of an olf version iis installed in it . it needs to be updated to use the latest version of linux anda gcc in docker. there arre some limiation in the used stuff that prevernts using new versions. you need to detect them and tell me what they are and help me to fix them. then give a dockerfile that set the enviremnet corectly. also it needs verilator that is installed in the docker image. so after we did there i will call you whitin the docker and we  will carry on from there,
